this is the solution outline.

 - clone the table which needs to have fixed header and place the cloned copy on top of original
 - remove the table body from top table
 - remove the table header from bottom table
 - adjust the column widths. (we are remembering the original column widths)

here's the demo - http://gomathikrishna.net/demos/scroll.html

this solution works in chrome & ie. since this is based on jquery this should work in other jquery supported browsers as well.
